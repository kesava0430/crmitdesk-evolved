/**
 * Capacitor turns this same React app into native Android and iOS builds.
 * The web deployment is untouched: `npm run build` still produces the exact
 * `dist/` nginx serves today. A native build is the same `dist/`, copied
 * into a native shell by `npx cap sync`.
 *
 * ── Two things a native build must do differently ───────────────────────
 *
 * 1. THE API URL MUST BE ABSOLUTE.
 *    On the web, VITE_API_URL is "/api" and nginx proxies it. Inside the
 *    app the WebView's origin is http://localhost (Android), so "/api"
 *    would resolve to the device itself and 404. Build native with:
 *
 *      VITE_API_URL=http://13.48.19.159:4000/api npm run build
 *
 * 2. CORS WOULD OTHERWISE BLOCK EVERY REQUEST.
 *    That WebView origin (http://localhost) is not the server's single
 *    CORS_ORIGIN value, so the browser would refuse every call. Enabling
 *    CapacitorHttp below routes requests through the NATIVE HTTP stack
 *    instead of the WebView — no preflight, no CORS, and no change needed
 *    on the server. It patches fetch and XMLHttpRequest, so the existing
 *    axios client in src/api/client.ts is carried along unmodified.
