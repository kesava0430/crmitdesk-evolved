# One-time: put app.zenkara.in on HTTPS with a free Let's Encrypt certificate.
#
# Why this is not optional: browsers refuse getUserMedia (face verification
# camera), geolocation (geofenced check-in, live location), service workers
# (PWA install, push nudges) on plain http:// — no prompt is ever shown, the
# camera box just stays black. Only https:// (and localhost) get those APIs.
#
# certbot's nginx plugin edits /etc/nginx/sites-available/app.zenkara.in in
# place: it adds a `listen 443 ssl` server with the certificate paths and
# turns the existing `listen 80` server into a redirect. Renewal is handled by
# the systemd timer certbot installs (twice daily; certs last 90 days).
#
# Run as root on the instance, after DNS for the domain points here and the
# security group allows inbound 80 and 443:
#
#   sudo bash /opt/zenkara-crm/deploy/enable-https.sh ops@zenkara.in
