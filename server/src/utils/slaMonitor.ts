/**
 * Detects tickets that have crossed their SLA resolution deadline
 * (Ticket.slaDueAt, computed from SlaPolicy.resolutionHours at ticket
 * creation — see tickets.controller.ts's calcSlaDue) while still open, and
 * fires every SLA-breach notification channel that already existed in the
 * codebase but was never actually wired to anything: the workflow engine's
 * SLA_BREACH trigger (any org's user-configured rule), plus Slack and Teams
 * (both already gated by their own per-org notifyOnSlaBreached toggle —
 * slackSlaBreached()/teamsSlaBreached() just needed a caller).
 *
 * The SlaBreaches table (schema.prisma) already existed for this too, but
 * nothing ever wrote to it — it's used here as both the audit trail and the
 * dedup marker: once a RESOLUTION breach row exists for a ticket, it's
 * never reprocessed, no matter how long the ticket stays open.
 *
 * Same in-process setInterval poller shape as scheduler.ts/dateAutomation.ts.
