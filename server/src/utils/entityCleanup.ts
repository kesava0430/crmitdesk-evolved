/**
 * Tidies up the polymorphic children of a record that is being deleted.
 *
 * Comments, Attachments and Tasks are all joined to their parent by a loose
 * `entityType` + `entityId` pair rather than a foreign key, so the database
 * cannot cascade them. Nothing cleaned them up, which meant:
 *
 *  - Attachment ROWS survived their parent forever. `remove()` in
 *    attachments.controller.ts calls assertEntityInOrg() *before* deleting,
 *    so once the parent was gone the row 404'd on every delete attempt —
 *    permanently undeletable through the API.
 *  - Attachment BLOBS survived too, in the org's Drive or in our hosted S3
 *    bucket, where they keep counting against the plan's storage quota
 *    (assertHostedStorageAvailable sums fileSize). An org could delete every
 *    record it owns and still be told it is out of space.
 *  - A recycled entityId — cuid collisions are not a practical worry, but
 *    seeded/imported data reusing ids is — would inherit the old record's
 *    comments and files.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort and never throws: losing a blob delete must
 * not fail the user's delete request, which has usually already committed by
 * the time we are called. Whatever a live purge misses is swept up later by
 * reapOrphanedAttachments().
